Rajshahi University Central Library (RUCL) introduced a digital system in the year 2016. It has been trying to establish an ETDs repository and its system since then. The ETDs repository in RUCL is at its primary stage now. It is managed by DSpace software and is developing day by day. However, it is simultaneously facing some problems. In this article, we will discuss the problems and possibilities of ETD management in RUCL.
