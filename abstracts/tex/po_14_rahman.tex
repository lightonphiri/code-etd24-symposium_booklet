Access to Electronic Theses and Dissertations (ETDs) is one of the recently introduced facilities in academic libraries. Obviously, there must be a digital library system to manage the ETDs. Rajshahi University Central Library (RUCL) introduced a digital system in the year 2016. It has been trying to establish an ETD repository and its system since then. The ETD repository in RUCL is at its primary stage now and is managed by the D-Space software. It is developing day by day, but at the same time, it is facing some problems. In this article, we will discuss the problems and possibilities of ETD management in RUCL.
