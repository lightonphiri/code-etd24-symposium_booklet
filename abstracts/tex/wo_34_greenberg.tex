        Many universities do not yet participate in the global network of digitized student theses or dissertations. The Networked Digital Library of Theses and Dissertations (NDLTD) wants to help universities to get started by sharing experiences of those that started ETD programs from nothing.  Among the topics to be covered are: (i) Lifecycle Management of ETDs; (ii) Institutional Partnerships; (iii) Technology--Institutional repositories and OAI-PMH; (iv) Iintellectual property issues; (v) Building an institutional concensus and (vi) Regional, National, and International support.

        Please bring quesitons for the NDLTD Board members and paper presenters.
